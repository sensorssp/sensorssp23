    <h2>The International Workshop on <br>Security and Privacy of Sensing Systems</h2>
    <p>
       The <b>First International Workshop on Security and Privacy of Sensing Systems (Sensors S&amp;P 2023)</b> will be held in conjunction with <a href="https://sensys.acm.org/2023/">ACM SenSys 2023</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As sensing systems become increasingly ubiquitous in various safety-critical IoT applications, such as smart cities, healthcare, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation, providing security and privacy guarantees becomes increasingly elusive. The widespread deployment of networked sensors and the rapid advancements in black-box deep learning models capable of encoding large amounts of information into embeddings have led to heightened concerns about the potential misuse of sensitive data and the vulnerability of these systems to malicious attacks. The shift from specialized, domain-specific sensors to universal sensor paradigms necessitates novel approaches to ensuring security and privacy in these complex IoT ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sensors S&amp;P workshop addresses the above and other unique challenges to providing security and privacy guarantees in IoT sensor systems. We will provide a forum for researchers, practitioners, and industry partners to exchange ideas, present novel research findings, and foster collaborations among participants related to sensor security and privacy. The event will cover a wide range of topics related to security and privacy in sensing systems, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
            <li>Assessing and mitigating security risks in safety-critical IoT applications</li>
            <li>Privacy-enhancing technologies for sensor data protection</li>
            <li>Secure communication protocols for sensor networks</li>
            <li>Secure and private sensor-fusion pipelines</li>
            <li>Authentication and access control mechanisms in IoT sensing systems</li>
            <li>Privacy-preserving machine learning and AI techniques for sensing systems</li>
            <li>Intrusion detection and response techniques for sensor networks</li>
            <li>Security and privacy challenges in IoT system interoperability</li>
            <li>Security and privacy issues in deep learning models for distributed sensing system</li>
            <li>Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies for secure IoT sensing</li>
            <li>Lightweight cryptographic algorithms for resource-constrained IoT devices</li>
            <li>End user security and privacy with human sensing interfaces</li>
            <li>Legal, regulatory, and ethical considerations in IoT security and privacy</li>
        </ul>
